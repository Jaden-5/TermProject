Project Description:
In my game 'King of the Pacific', the user can play an online version of Battleship board game with ‘AI’, or an algorithm, of different levels of difficulty. Each side starts with 5 ships, and the first side to sink each other's ships wins.  

To run this project, the player can run MAIN.py file. The game does not require any external files, fonts, or libraries.

There are two shortcut commands. Firstly, to restart the game, press the 'r' key. Secondly, to see solution or the layout of the opponent board, 's' key can be pressed. This will skip forward a lot of guesses.
